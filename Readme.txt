FaceOff7
A (paid) cydia tweak, source code available for editing/viewing/etc. It probably is pretty crappy code in most places…
More info: http://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=faceoff7Dp

After downloading the code with git, run ./rebuild-theos-dirs to apply for your theos installation (assumes you correctly set $THEOS)
Run this if you have errors about IOKit:
  cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS7.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework
  sudo ln -s Versions/A/IOKit .
